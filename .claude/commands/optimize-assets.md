# /optimize-assets

Optimize all game assets (images, audio, fonts) for minimum size while maintaining quality.

## Task

I\'ll optimize all assets in $ARGUMENTS using advanced compression techniques, procedural generation, and format selection to achieve maximum size reduction while preserving visual and audio quality.

## Process

I\'ll follow these steps:

1. **Asset inventory**: Catalog all images, audio, fonts, and other resources
2. **Format optimization**: Select optimal formats for each asset type
3. **Compression analysis**: Apply lossless and controlled lossy compression
4. **Procedural alternatives**: Evaluate code-generated replacements
5. **Integration testing**: Ensure optimized assets work correctly in-game

## Image Optimization

### Format Selection
- PNG vs JPEG vs WebP for different image types
- SVG conversion for simple graphics and icons
- Base64 inlining for small critical images
- CSS sprite generation for multiple small images

### Compression Techniques
- TinyPNG/TinyJPG for lossless compression
- ImageOptim for advanced optimization
- Color palette reduction for pixel art
- Dithering optimization for gradients

### Procedural Graphics
- CSS-generated shapes and patterns
- Canvas-drawn graphics from mathematical functions
- WebGL shader-based visual effects
- Parametric textures and sprites

## Audio Optimization

### Format and Encoding
- OGG vs MP3 vs AAC format selection
- Bitrate optimization for file size vs quality
- Sample rate reduction where appropriate
- Mono vs stereo channel optimization

### Procedural Audio
- Web Audio API synthesis for sound effects
- jsfxr-style parametric sound generation
- Mathematical music generation
- Real-time audio synthesis vs pre-recorded samples

## Font Optimization

### Subsetting
- Include only characters used in the game
- Remove unused font weights and styles
- Convert to WOFF2 for maximum compression
- Consider system font fallbacks

### Alternatives
- Icon fonts vs individual SVG icons
- CSS text effects vs font variations
- Web-safe font substitutions

## Advanced Techniques

### Size-Quality Trade-offs
- Progressive quality degradation analysis
- Critical vs non-critical asset identification
- Runtime asset loading strategies
- Asset priority optimization

I\'ll provide detailed before/after comparisons with exact byte savings and quality assessments for each optimization applied.
